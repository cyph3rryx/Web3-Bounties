# Superteam Consumer Crypto Ideation Bounty

Welcome to the Superteam Consumer Crypto Ideation Bounty repository! This bounty is all about coming up with the most interesting and creative ideas for consumer crypto that will help increase the utility of crypto to end-users.

## About the Bounty

For the "next billion users" and "mass adoption" of crypto to become a reality, the industry needs a strong consumer base. Adoption of crypto depends on the end-users/consumers finding some form of benefit (entertainment, utility, etc.) in using crypto.

Superteam is sponsoring this ideation bounty, inviting applicants to submit 3 to 5 consumer crypto ideas. The best ideas will receive cash & kind rewards.

We define "ideas" broadly here - it could mean anything, from unique content to projects to creator tooling, etc. Anything that helps increase the utility of crypto to consumers.

Ideas need not be restricted to Solana, and participants are encouraged to submit multiple ideas. We have provided a template for this bounty, which is optional to use and will not affect the overall judging process.

The most interesting and viable submissions will be selected as winners - please see the evaluation criteria below for more details.

## Evaluation Criteria

Ideas will be judged based on the following criteria:

    -> Creativity and originality
    -> Feasibility and practicality
    -> Impact and potential for increasing the utility of crypto to consumers
