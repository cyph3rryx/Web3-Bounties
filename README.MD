# Web3 Bounty Cracking Repository

Welcome to my Web3 bounty cracking repository! This repository is where I will be sharing my experiences and knowledge on cracking various Web3 bounties. As a passionate bounty hunter, I am always on the lookout for new and exciting bounties to tackle, and I will be documenting my journey here.


## How to Use This Repository

This repository is organized into different directories based on the type of bounties I have cracked. For example, if I have cracked a bounty related to NFTs, you can find the relevant files and documentation in the "NFT Bounties" directory.

To get started, you can navigate to the directory that interests you and explore the available files. Each directory will contain a README file that provides an overview of the bounties in that category and any relevant documentation or resources.

## How to Contribute

If you have any suggestions for new bounties for me to tackle, or if you have any feedback or contributions to the existing bounties, please feel free to reach out to me. You can create a new issue on this repository or contact me directly at Twitter [@PadhiyarRushi]. I am always open to collaboration and learning from others in the Web3 community.
